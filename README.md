## Work smarter, not harder. A default template for organizing your design files. ##

We've built interfaces for a large variety of applications, and we've always run into the same problems... reinventing the wheel for basic components, abandoning our wireframes assets once we start design, and having to go in and clean up our messy files after the fact so others can pick up where we left off. In short, we've spent too much time pixel-pushing, at the expense of time spent exploring the best approach to any given problem. 

So we created a standard set of sketch symbols, text styles, and shared styles in order to create efficiencies across the entire workflow. We spent time deciding on appropriate baseline hierarchies for typography, form field best practices, rem-based flexible grids, and more. The symbols are responsive-minded and stretchable from 320 mobile through ultra hd desktop. 

We've put this template to the test as a starter file for a couple of projects, and have had great success in speed and efficiency, particularly transitioning from low fidelity wireframes to visual design. Our goal was to provide a set of components that felt less like a contstained bootstrap pattern library, and more of an adaptable approach to interface design. 


###Introduction###

Take a look at the Example page artboard, specifically each of the layers used... All of them are tied to corresponding symbols, text styles, and/or shared styles, which are globally defined for the whole document. What does that mean? Let's say you have an application flow spanning 50+ different screen states. With this design system, you can update one element and push it out to all iterations of it.

We've provided some sensible defaults, but this framework is mostly meant to facilitate a good structure and process for your production design workflow.



### How to Use ###

1. Navigate to the "Style Masters" page; think of this as your master control center for your project.

2. Update the colors and typography as you see fit. (We've come up with some sensible defaults to get you started)

3. Don't forget to sync everything you've changed, so it cascades through the document.

4. Navigate to the symbols page; this is a starter set of basic components you may need for an interface design, for you to build off of. You should also notice any changes that you've made should now be applied to the typography and colors of these components. 

5. Navigate to the "Grid Templates" page; copy and paste one of the following artboards for your initial designs... this will pass a dedicated layout/grid to all of your subsequent artboards.

6. We've also provided some of the latest google material designs for easy access
